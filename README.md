Delta Hedging Simulator

This project implements a Delta Hedging simulation using historical price data for a listed security (e.g., AAPL) and models the P&L of a dynamically hedged options portfolio over time. It applies quantitative finance concepts like the Black-Scholes model, Greeks, and discrete rebalancing under realistic conditions (e.g., transaction costs, finite hedging frequency).

Core Concepts
	â€¢	Delta Hedging: A strategy that neutralizes directional risk by taking offsetting positions in the underlying asset and its derivative (option), based on the optionâ€™s delta.
	â€¢	Black-Scholes Pricing: Closed-form pricing of European options assuming log-normal asset returns, continuous trading, and constant volatility.
	â€¢	Historical Volatility Estimation: Realized volatility is estimated from log returns of adjusted close prices, annualized using âˆš252 scaling.
	â€¢	Path-Dependent P&L: The hedging error evolves based on how frequently and how accurately the portfolio is rebalanced.

Features
	â€¢	Real Data Simulation: Pulls real stock data via yfinance, normalizes the path to [0, 1] time scale.
	â€¢	Delta Rebalancing: Implements discrete hedging intervals (every n steps) with cash and asset position updates.
	â€¢	Transaction Costs: Models proportional costs (default: 0.1%) per trade to reflect realistic execution slippage.
	â€¢	Volatility Estimation: Computes historical volatility using daily log returns.
	â€¢	Greeks Tracking: Logs delta values at each timestep and visualizes their time evolution.
	â€¢	Interactive Plots:
	â€¢	Normalized asset price path
	â€¢	Delta over time
	â€¢	Hedged portfolio P&L trajectory

How It Works

Load historical price data (auto-adjusted)
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2024-01-01", end="2024-12-31", auto_adjust=True)

Estimate annualized historical volatility
sigma = np.std(np.log(data['Close'] / data['Close'].shift(1))) * np.sqrt(252)

Normalize price path to 0â€“1 scale and simulate
path = normalize_price_series(data['Close'])
portfolio, deltas = simulate_delta_hedging(path, K=S0, r=0.0443, sigma=sigma)



Future Improvements
	â€¢	Incorporate gamma risk and higher-order Greeks
	â€¢	Model stochastic volatility (e.g., using GARCH or SABR models)
	â€¢	Add multi-asset support or portfolio-level hedging
	â€¢	Backtest across multiple assets with rolling window calibration
